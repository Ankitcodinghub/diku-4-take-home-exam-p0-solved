Take-home Exam in Advanced Programming

Preamble

The exam consists of 2 questions. Your solution will be graded as a whole, on the 7-point grading scale, with an external examiner. The weight between the two questions is that

Question 1 counts for 60% and Question 2 counts for 40%. However, note that you must have both some working Haskell code and some working Erlang code to get a passing grade.

What To Hand In

To pass this exam you must hand in both a report and your source code:

‚Ä¢ The report should be around 5‚Äì10 pages, not counting appendices, presenting (at least) your solutions, reflections, and assumptions, if any. The report should contain all your source code in appendices. The report must be a PDF document.

Make sure that you follow the format specifications (PDF and .ZIP). If you don‚Äôt, the hand in will not be assessed and treated as a blank hand in. The hand in is done via the Digital Exam system (eksamen.ku.dk). Learning Objectives

To get a passing grade you must demonstrate that you are both able to program a solution using the techniques taught in the course and write up your reflections and assessments of your own work.

‚Ä¢ For each question your report should give an overview of your solution, including an assessment of how good you think your solution is and on which grounds you base your assessment. Likewise, it is important to document all relevant design decisions you have made.

‚Ä¢ In your programming solutions emphasis should be on correctness, on demonstrating that your have understood the principles taught in the course, and on clear separation of concerns.

‚Ä¢ To get a passing grade, you must have some non-trivial working code in both Haskell and Erlang.

Exam Fraud

This is a strictly individual exam, thus you arenot allowed to discuss any part of the exam with anyone on, or outside the course. Submitting answers (code and/or text) you have not written entirely by yourself, or sharing your answers with others, is considered exam fraud. Add

Breaches of the above policy will be handled in accordance with the Faculty of Science‚Äôs disciplinary procedures.

Question 1: APle:

Asimplecomputeralgebrasystem

Computer algebra system (CASs), such as Mathematica or Maple, are domain specific languages for manipulating ‚Äì often interactively ‚Äì mathematical expressions, for purposes such as algebraic simplification or symbolic differentiation.

Modern CASs actually have little, if any, knowledge of common mathematical syntax or semantics hard-wired into their core program code. Instead, they are based on relatively general-purpose term-rewriting engines that can be instantiated to many different tasks. In particular, such engines support repeatedly applying simple equations from algebra and calculus to transform a term into a desired form. As a special case, this rewriting can include just evaluating a closed arithmetic expression to a numeric result (like in a functional language), but CASs can also work meaningfully with terms containing unbound variables. In this question, you will implement a simple CAS called APle (pronounced like ‚Äúmaple‚Äù, but without the initial ‚Äòm‚Äô).

Informal presentation of APle

APle rewriting rules are written as algebraic equations between terms, considered as oriented from left to right. For example, here are some possible simplification rules (file tiny.ap) governing addition and multiplication (assuming that + and * have been declared as left-associative infix operators): Add 1 0 + t = t.

2 t + 0 = t.

3 t1 + (t2 + t3) = (t1 + t2) + t3.

4 t + t = 2 * t. 5 0 * t = 0.

(The rule numbers in the margin are just for reference in the following.) Rewriting a term consists of repeatedly matching the left-hand side (LHS) of a rule against a part of the term (by suitably instantiating variables in the rule) and replacing that subterm with the righthand side (RHS) of the rule (with the same instantiation applied).

For example, with the previous five rules, we can pose a query to simplify an expression:

&gt; 3 * (x + (0 + y)) ? 3*(x+y)

Note that this simplification can be achieved either by applying rule 1 to the subexpression 0 + y (instantiating t in the rule as y), or by first applying rule 3 (with t1 taken as x, t2 as 0, and t3 as y), and then rule 2 (with t as x).

&gt; (0+x)+(x+0) ??

0+x+(x+0) = 0+x+x+0 =

0+x+x = x+x

=

2*x

(Note that terms are output without redundant parentheses, given that + is declared as left-associative; but rules only match according to the underlying tree structure of the term. For example, we could not use rule 4 to rewrite the term 0+x+x+0 to 0+2*x+0, because the term is actually ((0+x)+x)+0, which does not have x+x as a subterm.)

Also, like in a functional language, all variables occurring on the RHS of the rule must be bound by the rule; otherwise an error is reported:

&gt; f(x) = y+1.

&gt; f(z)? f(z)

Error: Unbound var: yAdd

Sometimes we only want to apply a rule in particular circumstances. For example, if we want to move numeric constants to the end of an expression, we might add a conditional rule, n + t = t + n | num(n).

This says that we should only swap the arguments of an addition when the rule variable n is instantiated as a numeric constant (as checked by the built-in predicate num), while t can be an arbitrary term. (Note that this rule will still result in infinite rewriting on a term like 3 + 4.) A more general form of conditional rules also allows variables to be bound by computation: n1 + n2 = n3 | num(n1), num(n2), add(n1, n2; n3).

This says that we can constant-fold a +-expression: the built-in predicate add binds its third argument to the arithmetic sum of the first two, which must be numerals. (The semicolon separates input and output arguments to the predicate.) Adding this rule before the commutativity one will ensure that 3+4 gets rewritten to 7, rather than to 4+3.

Finally, as demonstrated previously, it is possible to accidentally specify rule sets that will lead to infinite rewriting in some cases. APle has two mechanisms for coping with this. First, if successive rewriting steps ever reach a term seen before, further rewriting would be pointless since (APle‚Äôs strategy being deterministic), we‚Äôd just go into an infinite loop. So, with the rules above (except the constant folding), we‚Äôd get:

&gt; 3 + (4 + y) ??

3+(4+y) =

3+4+y =

4+3+y =

4+3+y

Error: Loop

Second, any rewriting sequence will stop after a configurable number of steps. (For simplicity, this is just a constant maxSteps in AST; a more general approach would be to include it in GEnv so that it could be changed interactively.) For example,

&gt; t(x) = t(x+1) | num(x). &gt; t(5)? t(505) Error: Too many steps

Note that each recursive call involves two rewriting steps: t(5) = t(5+1) = t(6) = t(6+1) = ‚Ä¶. That is why we stop at 505, not at 1005.

A larger set of rules can be seen in Figure 1. With these definitions, a sample interaction could be: Add &gt; mypoly(x,y)=(x+y)**3.

&gt; mypoly(3,4)?

343

&gt; D(a,mypoly(a,b))? a*a+a*b+a*a+a*b+b*a+b*b+b*a+b*b+a*a+a*b+b*a+b*b With this introduction, we now present the details of the assignment.

Part 1: Syntax of APle

The full grammar of APle is shown in Figure 2 This grammar can be parsed into the following AST:

module AST where

type ErrMsg = String ‚Äî human-readable error messages

type VName = String ‚Äî variable names

type FName = String ‚Äî function (including operator) names

n1 + n2 = n3 | num(n1), num(n2), add(n1,n2;n3). n1 * n2 = n3 | num(n1), num(n2), mul(n1,n2;n3).

0 + t = t. t + 0 = t. t1 + (t2 + t3) = t1 + t2 + t3. t1 ‚Äì t2 = t1 + ~1 * t2.

0 * t = 0.

1 * t = t.

(t1 + t2) * t3 = t1 * t3 + t2 * t3. t * 0 = 0.

t * 1 = t. t1 * (t2 + t3) = t1 * t2 + t1 * t3. t ** 0 = 1. t ** n = t * t ** (n + ~1) | num(n). Add D(x,n) = 0 | num(n).

D(x,x) = 1.

D(x,y) = 0 | var(y), lexless(x,y). D(x,y) = 0 | var(y), lexless(y,x).

D(x,t1+t2) = D(x,t1) + D(x,t2).

D(x,t1*t2) = t1*D(x,t2) + t2*D(x,t1).

Since APle is a general-purpose system, none of the operators are hardcoded in the grammar. Rather, the available operators are specified in a separate operator table, such as arithmetic.op:

OpTable

[(FNone, [‚Äú&lt;=‚Äù, ‚Äú&lt;‚Äú]),

(FLeft, [‚Äú+‚Äù, ‚Äú-‚Äú]),

(FLeft, [‚Äú*‚Äù]),

(FRight, [‚Äú**‚Äù])]

Question 1.1: Parsing

Implement a parser for APle, in the file ParserImpl.hs The parser must provide the following top-level functions:

parseStringTerm :: OpTable -&gt; String -&gt; Either ErrMsg Term parseStringCmds :: OpTable -&gt; String -&gt; Either ErrMsg [Cmd]

Hint If you cannot get the general OpTable-parameterized parser to work, make the exported parser functions check that their first argument is precisely the fixed table in arithmetic.op, and hard-code this collection of operators in your grammar. Be sure to document the restriction in your report.

Question 1.2: Pretty-printing

Implement a pretty-printer for terms. The output should be a syntactically valid APle Term.

It should contain the minimal number of parentheses, and no whitespace. For example, with the standard operator table, the term Add

TFun ‚Äú*‚Äù [TNum 3,

TFun ‚Äú+‚Äù [TFun ‚Äú+‚Äù [TVar ‚Äúx‚Äù,

TFun ‚Äúf‚Äù [TVar ‚Äúy‚Äù,

TNum 4]], TVar

‚Äúz‚Äù]]

should pretty-print as the string ‚Äú3*(x+f(y,4)+z)‚Äù.

The printer, in PrinterImpl.hs, must provide the following function: printTerm :: OpTable -&gt; Term -&gt; String

Hint If you cannot get the OpTable-parameterized pretty-printer to work, make a first version that simply includes enough parentheses in the output that operator precedences and associativities do not matter. As a second version, make one that handles the fixed set of operators from arithmetic.op correctly, and prints all others with redundant parentheses, so that the output is still parseable. You might find the version that prints many parentheses useful in your testing.

Question 1.3: QuickChecking the syntax handling

In addition to the normal unit testing of the Parser and Printer modules separately, you should devise one or more QuickCheck tests, in file SyntaxQC.hs, that verify some nontrivial properties of the parser and/or printer.

It is important that your quick-check tests are black-box: they should only refer to the above-mentioned three top-level functions, as exported by the Syntax module. That is, your tests would also work (and potentially find bugs in) alternative implementations of the Syntax API. In the report, discuss briefly what kind of errors your QuickCheck tests would and would not be likely to find in someone else‚Äôs implementations of the Parser and Printer.

Part 2: Semantics of APle

We elaborate on the intended behavior of APle (beyond the previously given informal overview) in terms of concrete syntax for readability, but it is not a requirement that you have a functioning parser or printer to complete this part.

Rule-application terminologyA rule consists of a LHS term, a RHS term, and zero or more conditions. We say that a rule matches a term if we can consistently bind the rule‚Äôs variables to terms, such that the LHS instantiated according to those bindings becomes identical to the term we‚Äôre trying to match. The rule applies to the term if it matches, and additionally all the rule conditions (if any) are satisfied (as detailed below). The result of the application is the RHS of the rule, with all variables instantiated according to the bindings. (It is an error for the RHS to contain unbound variables.)

Finally, a rule appliesAdd inside a term if it applies to a proper subterm of the term. In that case,

the result of the whole application is the result of applying the rule to the subterm, placed into the subterm‚Äôs original context, as in normal equational reasoning about algebraic expressions.

‚Ä¢ If two potential rule applications are nested within each other the outermost is chosen.

For example, using the rules from tiny.ap in the informal presentation, the term 3 + 0 * (0 + x) is rewritten by rule 5 to 3 + 0 (and not by rule 1 to 3 + 0 * x).

‚Ä¢ If two potential rule applications are independent (non-nested), the leftmost is chosen.

For example, the term (3 + 0 * x) * (x + 0) is rewritten by rule 5 to (3 + 0) * (x + 0) (and not by rule 2 to (3 + 0 * x) + x).

‚Ä¢ If multiple rules apply at the same position in the term, the first one (in the order listed) is chosen. For example, the term 3 * (0 + 0) is rewritten by rule 1 to 3 * 0 (and not by rule 4 to 3 * (2 * 0)).

The built-in predicates are:

‚Ä¢ num(t) succeeds iff t is a numeric constant.

‚Ä¢ var(t) succeeds iff t is a variable.

‚Ä¢ add(t1,t2;t3) succeeds if t1 and t2 are numeric constants, and t3 can be bound to (or already is) their sum. For example, add(3,4;7) simply succeeds; add(3,4;x) (where x is not already bound) succeeds while binding x to 7; and add(3,4,8) fails. If t1 and/or t2 are not numbers, the predicate signals an error.

‚Ä¢ mul(t1,t2;t3) is analogous to add, only computing the product of the numbers, instead of their sum.

‚Ä¢ lexless(t1,t2)succeeds if the term t1 is lexicographically less than t2 (as defined by Haskell‚Äôs automatically derived Ord class instance on the type Term). In particular, if t1 and t2 are both numbers, the lexicographic ordering coincides with the usual arithmetic one; and if they are both variables, the ordering coincides with the string ordering on the variable names.

Any attempted invocations of predicates other than the above, or with the wrong argument counts, signal an error.Add

Question 1.4: A rewriting engine for APle

Your engine, in SemanticsImpl.hs should be organized as specified below. It is very important that you do not modify the types of any of the intermediate functions you are asked to implement, as they will be subjected to automated testing (as well as human inspection).

The Global monad and related functions

type GEnv = [Rule] newtype Global a = Global {runGlobal :: GEnv -&gt; Either (Maybe ErrMsg) a} instance Monad Global where ‚Ä¶

getRules :: Global [Rule] failS :: Global a failH ::

ErrMsg -&gt; Global a tryS :: Global a -&gt; Global a -&gt; Global a The Global monad organizes the general rewriting process, not related to any particular rule application. The GEnv type contains the list of all currently available rewrite rules, accessible at any time with the getRules function.

We also formalize that the rewriting can fail, in one of two ways: (1) soft failures, signaled by failS, which represent recoverable conditions, such as a particular rule LHS not matching a term, or a rule condition not being satisfied; and (2) hard failures, signaled by failH, which indicate that the rewriting process has encountered an irrecoverable error condition, such as referencing an unbound variable or predicate, or a rewriting loop. Soft failures carry no further data, while hard failures come with an error message to be reported; this correspond to the Maybe ErrMsg type in the Left branch of Global.

The function tryM m1 m2 runs m1; if that succeeds, its result is the result of the whole expression, and m2 is not used. If m1 signals a soft failure, m2 is run instead. On the other hand, if m1 signals a hard failure, then that will be returned, and m2 is again not used.

Complete the instance declaration of Global as a Monad (as well as Functor and Applicative, as usual), and define the related functions. The remainder of your code should never invoke the Global term constructor directly, but only through the above-defined functions. The Local monad and related functions

type LEnv= [(VName, Term)]

newtype Local a = Local {runLocal :: LEnv -&gt; Global (a, LEnv)} instance Monad Local where ‚Ä¶ inc :: Global a -&gt; Local a askVar :: VName -&gt; Local Term tellVar :: VNameAdd -&gt; Term -&gt; Local ()

The Local monad keeps track of variable bindings in the context of applying a single rule. The local environment LEnv is an extend-only association list (i.e., once a variable has been bound, it cannot be further modified). inc m views a Global computation m as a special case of a Local computation that simply does not access or modify the local environment. askVar v returns the current binding of v, or signals a hard failure (with a suitable error message) if the variable is unbound. tellVar v t binds v to t, if v is currently unbound. If v is already bound to t, tellVar does nothing; whereas if v is bound to some term other than t, tellVar signals a soft failure.

Again, the remainder of your code should not use the Local term constructor directly, but only the above-defined functions.

Matching and instantiation

matchTerm :: Term -&gt; Term -&gt; Local () instTerm :: Term &gt; Local Term

The function matchTerm p t attempts to match the subject term t against the pattern term p, potentially binding variables in p to the corresponding subterms of t (but not the other way around). If the match fails (possibly because of already existing conflicting variable bindings), matchTerm signals a soft failure.

instTerm t replaces all variables in t with their current values from the local environment. If t contains an unbound variable, a hard failure is signaled.

Conditions and rule application

evalCond :: PName -&gt; [Term] -&gt; Global [Term]

applyRule :: Rule -&gt; Term -&gt; Global Term

evalCond pn ts evaluates the predicate pn on the input arguments ts (which are assumed to have already been instantiated according to the local environment). If the predicate succeeds, it returns the values of its output arguments (if any), to be matched against the pattern terms (usually just variables) in the predicate invocation. If the predicate does not hold for the input arguments, it signals a soft failure. On the other hand, if the predicate is not defined, or invoked on illegal arguments, evalCond signals a hard failure.

applyRule r t attempts to apply the rewrite rule r to the term t. If this is not possible (e.g., because the rule LHS does not match t, or because one or more conditions in the rule is

not satisfied), applyRule signals a soft failure. On the other hand, if attempting to apply the rule leads to ahard failure (e.g., because the rule RHS contains an unbound variable, or

a condition mis-invokes a predicate), applyRule fails likewise.

Single-step term rewriting rewriteTerm :: Term -&gt; Global Term

rewriteTerm t attempts to rewrite the term once, by applying a rule anywhere withinAdd t according to the strategy defined for APle (i.e., outermost, leftmost, first). If no rule applies, rewriteTerm signals a soft failure. If attempting to apply a rule signals a hard failure, so does rewriteTerm. Top-level interaction

processCmd :: Cmd -&gt; GEnv -&gt; (Rsp, GEnv)

processCmd c ge processes the command c in the global environment ge, and returns a response and a possibly updated new global environment.

The command CRule r simply adds r to the end of the rule list in the global environment and returns an empty response (no terms and no message).

The command CQuery t True returns a response with the list of the successive rewritings of t (starting with t itself). If the rewriting stopped because no further rules applied, there is no message. If rewriting stopped because of an error (either during a rewriting step, or because of a detected loop or timeout), the message will say so; see the examples in the informal presentation. In any case, the global environment is unchanged. The command CQuery t False is similar, but includes only the last term in the rewriting list (i.e., the final result, or the term at which the error occurred), not all the preceding ones.

If you don‚Äôt get through all groups, do as many as you can: you will get partial credit for each correctly working (and properly tested/assessed) group.

General instructions

Each of the two parts (Syntax and Semantics) will be weighted roughly equally in the assessment. However, as a matter of exam technique, keep in mind that it‚Äôs probably significantly easier to produce incomplete but acceptable solutions to both parts, than a near-perfect solution to only one of them.

Put all your files in the src/APle/‚Ä¶ directory. Please do use the provided skeleton files: they have all the types, imports and exports set up correctly, which should significantly decrease the risk of your solution failing our automated tests. Remember to assess your code in the report (including a description of how you tested it, and how we can reproduce your tests), and to include your source code in appendices.

Question 2: RoboTA

This question is about making RoboTA, an alternative to the renowned OnlineTA system. For teachers, a RoboTA server can hold a number of assignments, each assignment consists of a number of parts and each part has a grader. For students, it is possible to submit a submission for an assignment to a RoboTA server to get the submission analysed and get feedback based on the analysis.

Terminology:

‚Ä¢ An assignment consists of a list of parts. A part is a pair {Label, Grader}, where Label is an atom and Grader is a grader. All labels on parts in an assignment should be different.

An assignment can either be available or unavailable. It‚Äôs only possible to add parts to an assignment when it‚Äôs unavailable, and it‚Äôs only possible to submit submissions for grading when it‚Äôs available.

‚Ä¢ A submission consists of a list of labeled answers. A labeled answer is a pair {Label, Answer}, where Label is an atom and Answer is an appropriate Erlang term.

We say that a submission isvalid with respect to an assignment, if the labels in the

submission are a subset of the labels in the assignment. (The order doesn‚Äôt matter.) If a submission contains multiple answers with the same label, only one of them is graded and it is unspecified which of the answers is graded.

We say that a submission is partial if it does not contain answers to all parts of an assignment.

‚Ä¢ Feedback is a list of labeled results. A labeled result is a pairAdd {Label, Result}, where Label is an atom and Result is an appropriate Erlang term.

Feedback with respect to an assignment contains results for all parts of the assignment. For a partial submission, the result of missing parts should be the atom missing.

‚Ä¢ A grader analyses a labeled answer and gives a result of the analysis. A grader can either be a simple grader or a composed grader made of other graders, each dealing with different aspects of the analysis.

For a labeled answer, {Label, Answer} = LAnswer, we have the following graders:

‚Äì A forgiving grader is the atom abraham. The result of a forgiving grader is always the atom looks_good no matter the answer.

‚Äì An angry grader is the atom niels. The result of an angry grader is always the atom failed no matter the answer.

‚Äì A matching grader is the tuple {mikkel, Expect} where Expect is an Erlang term. If Answer is exactly equal to Expect (compared with =:=) then the result is looks_good otherwise it is failed.

‚Äì A testing grader is the tuple {simon, Arg, Expect} where Arg and Expect are

Erlang terms. The grader expects Answer to be a function and if Answer(Arg) is exactly equal to Expect (compared with =:=) then the result is looks_good otherwise it is failed.

‚Äì A modular grader is the tuple {andrzej, Callback, Init} where Callback is an atom denoting a grading callback module and Init is the argument to the setup function from Callback. The result of the grader is the result of calling the grade function from Callback with the argument LAnswer. Grading callback modules are described later in this question.

‚Äì A concurrent grader is the tuple {troels, Gs} where Gs is a list and each element in Gs is a grader. The result is the list of results obtained by using each grader in Gs on LAnswer in the order as Gs. The graders cannot rely on any order of execution, thus they can be executed concurrently. If any grader fails, all graders should be exited and the result should be grader_failed. Remember that a grader can have side-effect, such as writing to the file system.

A grader can fail if it calls a function that exits in any non-normal fashion, or if the result takes longer than 3 seconds to be computed (in which case all computations in the grader should be stopped). The result of a failed grader is the atom grader_failed. Note that, a grader can successfully give the result failed for a submission, which is different from grader_failed.

‚Ä¢ A grader module should export (at least) the functions:

‚Äì setup(Init)for performing any initialisation necessary for the module. Re- turns {ok, State} on success, and {error, Reason} if some error occurred.

‚Äì grade(State, LAnswer) for grading a labeled answer. Here, State is what is returned byAdd setup/1, and LAnswer is a labeled answer. Returns {ok, Result} on success, and {error, Reason} if some error occurred and the grader failed.

‚Äì unload(State) for performing any module level cleanup. Returns ok on success, and {error, Reason} if some error occurred. If any processes were started by the module, it is the responsibility of unload/1 to stop them.

You can find an example grader module in Appendix A.

Part 1: The RoboTA module

Implement an Erlang module robota with the following API:

‚Ä¢ get_the_show_started() for starting a RoboTA server. Returns {ok, RoboTA} on success or {error, Reason} if some error occurred.

‚Ä¢ new(RoboTA, Name) for creating a new assignment with the name Name. Returns {ok, AssHandler} on success or {error, Reason} if some error occurred. Here, AssHandler is the authorised handle to the assignment for the teacher. It is the teacher‚Äôs responsibility to keep AssHandler secret. The assignment starts as unavailable.

‚Ä¢ add_part(AssHandler, Label, Grader) for adding a part labeled Label to AssHandler with the grader Grader. Returns ok on success or {error, Reason} if some error occurred, where Reason should be {Name, is_available} if the assignment is available, and Name is the name of the assignment. Reason should be {Label, not_unique} if Label is not unique in the assignment.

‚Ä¢ del_part(AssHandler, Label) for deleting the part labeled Label from AssHandler. This should be an non-blocking function.

The function has no effect if the assignment is available or if there is no part labeled Label in the assignment.

‚Ä¢ available(AssHandler) for making the assignment available. When an assignment is made available all modular graders should be initialised. Returns ok on success or {error, Reason} if some error occurred, for instance that a setup function from a modular grader threw an exception. If some error occurred and the assignment was unavailable then the assignment stays unavailable.

‚Ä¢ unavailable(AssHandler) for making an assignment unavailable. When an assignment is made unavailable it stops accepting new submissions for grading, and finishes grading all submissions currently being graded. This function returns when there are no submissions under grading, and all modular graders in the assignment have been unloaded. Returnsok on success or {error, Reason} if some error occurred, for instance that an unload function from a modular grader threw an exception. Even if some error occurred the assignment should be unavailable after this function returns.

‚Ä¢ status(AssHandler) for examining the state of an assignment. Returns {Status, Parts} where Status is one of the atoms available or unavailable, and Parts is the list of parts in the assignment. The order ofAdd Parts is unspecified.

‚Ä¢ grade(RoboTA, Name, Submission, Pid) for sending a submission for grading to the assignment named Name (the argument given to new/2). Returns Ref quickly, where Ref is a reference. Quickly means before the submission is graded.

When the result of the grading is ready it is sent as an Erlang message to Pid on the form {Ref, Response}, where Ref is the reference returned by grade, and Response is either {ok, Result} if the submission was successfully graded or

{error, Reason} if some error occurred. If the assignment is unavailable Reason should be {Name, is_unavailable}.

Desirable properties:

‚Ä¢ We want to minimise the latency of the grading of submissions. Thus, the grading of a submission should not block the grading of other submissions.

‚Ä¢ RoboTA should be robust against malicious input from students. Meaning that it should not be possible for students to make a submission that crashes RoboTA.

‚Ä¢ RoboTA should be robust against incompetence from teachers. Meaning that it should not be possible for teachers to make a grader that crashes RoboTA.

Robustness in the desirable properties should be interpreted within reason and scope of the course. Thus, you should not start to look into, say, sandboxing of processes or trying to control which libraries a process or function can call. Don‚Äôt overthink it, but make sure that you document what your interpretation of robustness mean.

Part 2: Use RoboTA

Write a test program that consists of two modules, demo and demo_grader:

‚Ä¢ demo starts a RoboTA server.

‚Ä¢ there should be a teacher process that creates a new assignment with multiple parts, where there is at least one of each kind of grader, including a modular grading.

‚Ä¢ demo_grader is a grading callback module.

‚Ä¢ the assignment should be made available

‚Ä¢ a submission should submitted for grading

‚Ä¢ the result of the grading should be successfully received

‚Ä¢ the assignment should be made unavailable.

Part 3: QuickCheck RoboTA

Make a module robota_qc that uses QuickCheck for testing a robota module. We will test your robota_qcAdd module with our special version of the robota module, so your tests should only rely on the API described in the exam text.

Your module should export:

‚Ä¢ A generator of graders named grader/0.

‚Ä¢ A generator of assignments named assignment/0 that generates a list of parts.

‚Ä¢ At least two properties related to robota that starts with the prefix prop_. For these, you‚Äôll probably need other generators than just grader/0 and assignment/0.

‚Ä¢ If you have properties that are specific to your implementation of robota (perhaps they are related to an extended API or you are testing a sub-modules of your implementation), they should start with the prefix myprop_, we will test these with your own implementation of robota.

General comments

Part 1 counts for 70% of this question, Part 2 counts for 10%, and Part 3 counts for 20% of this question.

Document which properties your module provides (and under which assumptions). Likewise you should document if you have implemented all parts of the question. Remember to detail in your report how you have tested your module. In general, as always, remember to test your solution and include your test in the hand-in.

Appendix A: Example Grader Module

An example grader module that gives seemingly random, but consistent grades. Meaning, that the same answer will always get the same grade while the assignment is available.

-module(consistentgrader).

-export([setup/1, grade/2, unload/1]).

setup(_) -&gt;

Now = erlang:system_time(microsecond), Bin = term_to_binary(Now), &lt;&lt;Salt:8,

_/binary&gt;&gt; = erlang:md5(Bin), {ok, Salt}.

grade(Salt, {_, Answer}) -&gt;

Bin = term_to_binary(Answer),

&lt;&lt;Desider:8, _/binary&gt;&gt; = erlang:md5(Bin),

{ok, case (Desider + Salt) rem 2 of 0 -&gt; looks_good;

_ -&gt; failed end}.

unload(_Salt) -&gt; ok.
